Also mention that if there is any skill that the job requires and I don't have it‚Äîit's just a skill, it takes me less than a week to acquire new tech skills‚ÄîI am a straight A student, with excellent academic record and I am the person at work that managers and senior managers "trust" with everything‚Äîsee my LinkedIn recommendations from my ex managers. Do not invent any figures or information, use only the information given in the resume. I am a great team player and my best comes out at work. I was so good where I interned, they hired me as soon as my internship was done, I had made a place in the team. So write an amazing cover letter. Source all quantitative claims from resume, do not invent anything.
